<strong><ins>what weakness to be mentioned</ins> </strong>  <br/>  <hr/>
<small>Put your weaknesses in a positive light
    Once you've established your weakness,
     craft a response to put it in the most positive light. How do you do that? Here are three suggestions:
    
    Emphasize the positive, avoiding negative words like failure or inept.
    Talk about how you've transformed your weakness into a strength.
    Show how you recognize where you need to improve and take steps to better yourself.
    What are ways you can improve yourself to address a weakness?
    
    Take a class or get training.
    Discover tools, such as apps, to track your time, schedule breaks or collaborate more smoothly.
    Work with a mentor.
    Engage in volunteer work to build a skill.
    Join professional groups or industry associations.
    Sample responses to 'What are your weaknesses?'
    The question gives you the opportunity to set yourself apart.
     How so? You can show the hiring manager you recognize the areas where you need to
      upgrade yourself and how you're taking steps to address them. Here's a sample answer that takes this approach:
    
    “Although I always met my deadlines, I used to have a problem with procrastination, 
    and I'd end up working really long days as a deadline approached. 
    I decided that I needed to deal with the issue, so I took classes on project management and time management. 
    I learned how to organize my days and attack bigger projects in manageable chunks. Now, I put together a 
    plan as soon as I get a new assignment, and I often beat my deadlines.”
    Another example illustrates how to use the requirements of the job to drive your answer.
     Let's say you're not a strong writer,
      and you're applying for a job as a graphic designer.
       The job description emphasizes the need for production design skills and specific software experience
        but doesn't mention anything about content creation.
         In this scenario, you could answer the question about weaknesses in an interview like this:
    
    “I've always been on the design side of things and haven't had much experience with content development,
     so I'd say that's a weakness for me. However, I'm a quick learner,
      and I believe I could improve my writing skills if I ever needed to for my job.”
    Alternatively,
     if you're applying for a position as a financial analyst and one of the requirements of the job is to give regular reports to upper management,
      you won't want to emphasize to the hiring manager that you struggle with communication issues. </small>
